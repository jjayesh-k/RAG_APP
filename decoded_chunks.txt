========================================

--- CHUNK 1 ---
A vision that placed the greater good of society at par with business growth. A vision that put into practice pioneering social initiatives that changed the               way responsible business was run.

========================================

--- CHUNK 2 ---
And a vision that brought into the group a strong social conscience.

But we think we started on sound and straightforward         business principles, considering the interests of the shareholders our own, and          the health and welfare of the employees, the sure foundation of our success.

========================================

--- CHUNK 6 ---
The Tata Code of Conduct was first formalized by Mr Ratan Tata.

========================================

--- CHUNK 7 ---
It articulates      the Group’s values and ideals that guide and govern the conduct of our companies as well as our      colleagues in all matters relating to business.

========================================

--- CHUNK 8 ---
Today, the Code is a bedrock on which we base our      individual, as well as leadership commitments to core Tata values.

========================================

--- CHUNK 9 ---
The Tata Code of Conduct outlines our commitment to each of our stakeholders, including the      communities in which we operate, and is our guiding light when we are sometimes faced with                                             business dilemmas that leave us at ethical crossroads.

========================================

--- CHUNK 10 ---
The Code is also dynamic in that it has      been periodically refreshed in order to remain contemporary and contextual to the changes in      law and regulations.

========================================

--- CHUNK 11 ---
However it remains unaltered at its core.

========================================

--- CHUNK 12 ---
Our stellar reputation and success as a business entity has been defined by the powerful      commitment and adherence to the core values and principles expressed in this Code, by all our                                             employees, directors and partners.

========================================

--- CHUNK 13 ---
I trust every Tata colleague and Tata company will continue      to not only comply with the laws and regulations that govern our business interests around the      world, but will continue to set new standards of ethical conduct that will generate deep respect      and inspire emulation by others.

You should assist your colleague in correcting the inaccuracy during the meeting if possible. If this is       not possible, raise the issue with your colleague after the meeting to enable him/her or the company       to correct any misrepresentation made to the customer.

========================================

--- CHUNK 329 ---
But that is not the sole reason why I have been an admirer of Jamsetji.

========================================

--- CHUNK 330 ---
The major reason was his sense of values, sterling values, which he           imparted to this group.

========================================

--- CHUNK 343 ---
In the       final shortlist of two companies, one is a new start-up with limited references and a lower       price-quotation, while the other is a Tata company with thirty years of implementation       experience and good references, but a marginally higher quote for the same job.

========================================

--- CHUNK 344 ---
With all       other parameters of choice being nearly equal, which company should you select for the job?

========================================

--- CHUNK 345 ---
W hile price is undoubtedly an important criterion for decision making, it is clearly not the only one       to be evaluated.

========================================

--- CHUNK 346 ---
You may also need to consider good customer references, proven track record and       shared value systems in order to decide on your IT partner.

========================================

--- CHUNK 347 ---
you are in the process of selecting potential vendors for a project.

========================================

--- CHUNK 348 ---
one of the three finalists       is a group company.

========================================

--- CHUNK 349 ---
In reviewing the final proposals, you rank the group company second       out of the three proposals based on pricing and total cost of ownership, and select the       first-ranked vendor.

========================================

--- CHUNK 350 ---
Is this the right decision?

========================================

--- CHUNK 351 ---
Y es.

========================================

--- CHUNK 352 ---
You should select the vendor that, on its own merits, is the vendor that is most appropriate for       your company’s requirements.

========================================

--- CHUNK 353 ---
You should not select a group company only because of its affiliation.

No.

========================================

--- CHUNK 365 ---
Discuss the situation with your supervisor to be certain that       you both understand the facts.

========================================

--- CHUNK 366 ---
If your concerns are not resolved, contact a higher level supervisor,       the Ethics Counsellor, the Legal department or report them via the company’s confidential reporting       system, if available. I feel that my supervisor is treating me unfairly for reporting a concern to the Ethics       Counsellor.

========================================

--- CHUNK 367 ---
What should I do?

========================================

--- CHUNK 368 ---
Retaliation against anyone who raises a concern is a violation of the Code.

========================================

You should therefore       promptly report this action of your supervisor to the Ethics Counsellor or the MD/CEO of your       company or via the company’s confidential reporting system, if available.

========================================

--- CHUNK 377 ---
• Is it illegal/unlawful or out of line with our policies and procedures?

========================================

--- CHUNK 378 ---
• Does my conscience reject it?

========================================

--- CHUNK 379 ---
Does it conflict with my personal values?

========================================

--- CHUNK 380 ---
• Would I feel uncomfortable if the story appeared in the media?

========================================

--- CHUNK 381 ---
Would it shame my company,         spouse, partner, parent or child?

========================================

--- CHUNK 382 ---
• Does it ‘feel’ wrong?

========================================

--- CHUNK 383 ---

========================================

--- CHUNK 391 ---
I have read the Tata Code of Conduct and I acknowledge that as a Tata employee, I am required to      comply with the guidelines described therein and failure to do so may subject me to action as per my      employment terms and relevant company policies.

If I have a concern about a violation, or a potential violation of the Tata Code of Conduct, I understand      that there are channels available to me in my company to report such concerns.

By making use of these      channels when necessary, I will play my part in maintaining the high ethical standards to which we      hold ourselves.
