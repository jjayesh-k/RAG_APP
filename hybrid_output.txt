           FOREWORD                                                         
                                                                            
           Tata companies have consistently adhered to the values and ideals articulated by the Founder
                                                                            
           for over 150 years. The Tata Code of Conduct was first formalized by Mr Ratan Tata. It articulates
           the Group’s values and ideals that guide and govern the conduct of our companies as well as our
           colleagues in all matters relating to business. Today, the Code is a bedrock on which we base our
           individual, as well as leadership commitments to core Tata values.
                                                                            
           The Tata Code of Conduct outlines our commitment to each of our stakeholders, including the
           communities in which we operate, and is our guiding light when we are sometimes faced with
                                                                            
           business dilemmas that leave us at ethical crossroads. The Code is also dynamic in that it has
           been periodically refreshed in order to remain contemporary and contextual to the changes in
           law and regulations. However it remains unaltered at its core.   
                                                                            
           Our stellar reputation and success as a business entity has been defined by the powerful
           commitment and adherence to the core values and principles expressed in this Code, by all our
                                                                            
           employees, directors and partners. I trust every Tata colleague and Tata company will continue
           to not only comply with the laws and regulations that govern our business interests around the
           world, but will continue to set new standards of ethical conduct that will generate deep respect
           and inspire emulation by others.

                  ever, that corporate enterprises must be managed not merely in the interests
                  of their owners, but equally in those of their employees, of the consumers of
                  their products, of the local community and finally of the country as a whole.

             A job requirement entails extensive travel. one of the candidates has excellent relevant
             experience and qualifications. However, this candidate is a single parent. As a result, I feel
             such a situation would significantly hinder this candidate’s ability to cope with the job
             requirement. What should I do?                                 
             In accordance with the Code, the decision to recruit an employee should be based upon merit. We
             cannot make a presumption that the candidate would not be able to meet the travel requirements of
             the job. All eligible candidates should be provided with equal opportunity to demonstrate or justify
             that they can cope with the travel requirements of the job. Being a single parent cannot be a ground
             to be discriminated against at any stage of recruitment or ongoing employment in our company.

             As a general rule, we may accept gifts or hospitality from a business associate, only if such a gift:

                is entitled to preferential treatment of any kind;          
             •  would not influence, or appear to influence, our ability to act in the best interest of our company;
             •  would not embarrass our company or the giver if disclosed publicly.
             The following gifts are never appropriate and should never be given or accepted:
             •  gifts of cash or gold or other precious metals, gems or stones;

             I am an accountant in the finance department of my company. Due to my artistic skills,
             I received an offer to pen cartoons for a children’s publication for which I would receive
             compensation. I plan to undertake this activity during week-ends. What should I do before
             accepting this offer?                                          
             Before accepting the offer, you should ascertain whether the company policies and rules require
             you to make a disclosure to your supervisor so that the company may determine whether your
             undertaking this activity adversely affects our company’s interests. On confirmation from the
             company that it does not do so, you would be free to take up the activity. It is also your duty to bring
             to the attention of the company whenever there is any change in the situation you have disclosed.

             our company has recently announced the launch of a new business initiative. In connection
             with this, your friend who is a journalist with a leading business newspaper has asked you
             to provide some information that he could cover in his forthcoming article. He has promised
             not to quote you, or reveal your identity. Should you be giving him this information?
             No. You should not be sharing information of this nature with the media, even if it is assured that the
             source would remain anonymous. Only authorised personnel in the company are permitted to speak
             to the media and provide information of this nature.           
             our company has a “Use of Social media” policy that lays down the “dos and don’ts” for use of
             social media even if you may access such media on your own time. Why is there such a policy?
             External communication is a serious matter. It must be carefully managed because information put
             out with reference to our company or its businesses needs to be clear, truthful and not violate any
             undertakings we have given to other parties. In each business there are managers nominated to authorise
             and make different types of statements to the outside world. These managers should be consulted about
             any request for information you may receive or information you think we should give out.
             In using social media, in particular blogs or social networking sites, you should exercise great caution
             while talking about our company or the business we do. It may feel like you are chatting with
             friends or expressing a personal opinion but even while doing so you cannot share any confidential
             information of our company.

             We must respect the property rights of others by never misusing their assets, intellectual property
             or trade secrets, including the copying or downloading of unauthorised software, trademarks,
             copyrighted material or logos. We should never make unauthorised copies of computer software

             you are in a relationship with a colleague who has been recently moved into your team and
             would now be reporting to you. What should you do?             
             Romantic or close personal relationships with another employee where a reporting relationship
             exists and one is responsible for evaluating the other’s performance, is likely to create a conflict of
             interest. In such a situation, you would need to report the potential conflict to your supervisor.
             your company is submitting a proposal to a company in which you were previously employed.
             you have confidential information pertaining to your previous employer, which you believe
             will help your present employer in winning the contract. Should you share this information?
             No. You should not share this information with your company since it relates to confidential
             information of a third party. Your company respects its employees’ duty to protect confidential
             information that they may have relating to their previous employers.
             you are the purchasing manager in the procurement department of your company. you
             receive an invitation from a supplier to attend a premier sporting event as her guest. This
             particular supplier is one of the vendors who has submitted a proposal for an open tender
             issued by your company. Should you accept the invitation?      
             No. You should not accept the invitation in this instance. Since you are in a key decision-making role

             you are the Regional Sales manager of our company. you have become a member of an
             “informal group”, on an instant messaging service, whose members are the regional sales
             heads of our company’s competitors. The administrator of the group has requested an
             in-person meeting to informally discuss market conditions and brainstorm on “pricing
             strategy” from an industry perspective. What should you do?    
                                                                            
             Any meeting with competitors, especially to discuss “pricing strategy”, could be an attempt to
             promote an anti-competitive practice or manipulate prices. You should respond by declining this
             invitation and exiting the “informal group”. You should also report this incident to your supervisor
             and your Legal department.                                     
             you are attending a customer meeting with a colleague, and your colleague makes an
             untruthful statement about the company’s services. What should you do?
                                                                            
             You should assist your colleague in correcting the inaccuracy during the meeting if possible. If this is
             not possible, raise the issue with your colleague after the meeting to enable him/her or the company
             to correct any misrepresentation made to the customer.         
             While working on a customer project, you receive a call from your colleague. He used
             to manage that customer account before you took over his role. He recalls that he had
             worked with the customer on developing a new ordering system which he thinks would
             be beneficial for another customer and requests you to send him the project details.
             What should you do?

             a project that you are working on. In order to complete the project within the targeted costs,
             you intend to request your supplier to provide you an exceptional discount on this project
             order on the understanding that you would “make it up to him” in future orders. Would you

                   I do not think anyone was on par with Jamsetji as an industrial visionary.
                    But that is not the sole reason why I have been an admirer of Jamsetji.
                     The major reason was his sense of values, sterling values, which he
                     imparted to this group. If someone were to ask me, what holds the
                                                                            
                    Tata companies together, more than anything else, I would say it is our
                    shared ideals and values which we have inherited from Jamsetji Tata.

             you are in the process of selecting potential vendors for an IT project in our company. In the
             final shortlist of two companies, one is a new start-up with limited references and a lower
             price-quotation, while the other is a Tata company with thirty years of implementation
             experience and good references, but a marginally higher quote for the same job. With all
             other parameters of choice being nearly equal, which company should you select for the job?
             W hile price is undoubtedly an important criterion for decision making, it is clearly not the only one
             to be evaluated. You may also need to consider good customer references, proven track record and
             shared value systems in order to decide on your IT partner.    
             you are in the process of selecting potential vendors for a project. one of the three finalists
             is a group company. In reviewing the final proposals, you rank the group company second
             out of the three proposals based on pricing and total cost of ownership, and select the

             I do not do what I am told, I could lose my job. Should I do it?
             No. Breaking the law is never an option. Discuss the situation with your supervisor to be certain that
             you both understand the facts. If your concerns are not resolved, contact a higher level supervisor,
             the Ethics Counsellor, the Legal department or report them via the company’s confidential reporting

             Retaliation against anyone who raises a concern is a violation of the Code. You should therefore
             promptly report this action of your supervisor to the Ethics Counsellor or the MD/CEO of your
             company or via the company’s confidential reporting system, if available.

             If you are unsure whether a particular action you are about to take is consistent with the principles
             set forth in the Code, ask yourself:                           
             •  Could it directly or indirectly endanger someone or cause them injury?
             •  Is it illegal/unlawful or out of line with our policies and procedures?
             •  Does my conscience reject it? Does it conflict with my personal values?
             •  Would I feel uncomfortable if the story appeared in the media? Would it shame my company,
                spouse, partner, parent or child?                           
                                                                            
             •  Does it ‘feel’ wrong?                                       
             If the answer to any of these questions is “Yes”, please stop and consult your reporting manager,
             the Ethics Counsellor, the Human Resource department, the Legal department or any member of
             the senior management team, to assist you in making the decision.

           advisories and policies, company-level policies, procedures and work rules as relevant. For any guidance
           on interpretation of the Code, we may seek support from our company’s Ethics Counsellor or from the
